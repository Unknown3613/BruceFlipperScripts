# 🧠 HID Payload Batch Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Batch scripts intended for use in HID-style attack scenarios — where a USB device emulates a keyboard to quickly inject commands into a target machine.

These scripts are designed to be fast, simple payloads that could be adapted for use with BadUSB devices like Rubber Ducky, Flipper Zero, Digispark, or any other HID emulation platform.

## ⚠️ Not Tested for BadUSB Execution
These scripts were written as normal `.bat` files and have **not** been tested on actual BadUSB hardware.  
They haven’t been encoded into Ducky Script, tested for execution timing, or optimized for input delay quirks.

That said, I’ve included them here in case they’re useful, or if someone wants to modify and test them for real-world use.

🧪 **You’ll likely need to tweak them before using with any HID payload injector.**

## 🔄 File Format Note
The scripts are uploaded with a `.txt` extension to avoid automatic blocking or antivirus flags.  
To use them, just rename each file from `.txt` to `.bat`.

**Example (Windows 10):**


## 💬 Why This Exists
Sometimes you just need quick and dirty payloads to:

- Prototype ideas 💡
- Experiment 🧪
- Break out of the copy-paste loop 🔁

These scripts are rough, untested for BadUSB, and not guaranteed to work out of the box — but they’re here anyway.  
Use them however you see fit… within reason.

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer 🚫
It is **illegal** to tamper with systems, devices, or networks that you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.
